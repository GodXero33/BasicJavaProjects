# Fashion Shop T-Shirt Order Management System

### Coursework 07 - iCET

#### Case Study Overview

The **Fashion Shop**, a recently launched online T-shirt store, handles a large volume of transactions every day. To streamline operations and manage online T-shirt orders efficiently, the shop owner requires a custom system.

As a talented student from the **Institute of Computer Engineering Technology (iCET)**, I have been given the opportunity to develop this system as part of my coursework.
