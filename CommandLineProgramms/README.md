# Command Line Programs

This folder contains various command-line-based Java programs developed as part of my coursework at the Institute of Computer Engineering Technology (iCET). Each program is designed to demonstrate core Java concepts and problem-solving techniques using the command-line interface.

All coursework-related programs will be stored here for easy access and review.
